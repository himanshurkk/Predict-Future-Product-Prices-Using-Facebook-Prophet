# Predict-Future-Product-Prices-Using-Facebook-Prophet

## Introduction
In this hands-on project, we will train time-series prediction models to predict future product prices. This project could be practically applied in the banking, retail, and healthcare sectors. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: 

1. Project overview 
2. Import libraries and dataset 
3. Explore dataset 
4. Prepare the data for Facebook prophet 
5. Understand the intuition behind Facebook Prophet 
6. Develop model and make predictions - Part A 
7. Develop model and make predictions - Part B.

## Key Concepts
- Understand the theory and intuition behind Facebook Prophet Time series prediction tool.
- Build a predictive model to forecast future product prices
- Apply seaborn and matplotlib to perform images visualization
- Compile and fit forecasting model to training data
- Assess trained model performance
